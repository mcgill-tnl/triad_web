                <p>Dementia affects over half a million Canadians, with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounting for 60-80
                    percent of the cases (1,2). The disease mainly affects cognitive functioning and is often
                    progressive (meaning it worsens over time), which leaves the affected individuals highly
                    debilitated. Currently, in most progressive dementias, including AD, there is no cure or treatment
                    to slow or stop the progression (2). As the aging population grows, dementia poses a rising
                    challenge in our healthcare system. It is projected that the healthcare cost associated with
                    dementia will increase to $16.6 billion by 2031 (3). This crisis calls for a need to expand on
                    research for novel approaches to diagnose and treat dementia.
                    <br><br>
                    The Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort was established in 2017 to conduct
                    leading studies on AD and other types of dementias. The cohort is composed of patients from the MCSA
                    and the general public. Currently, over 1000 people are enrolled in the TRIAD cohort and around 500
                    of them are participating in a study. The specific study measurements for subjects depend on the
                    project, but the subjects generally undergo baseline and yearly follow-up appointments that include
                    the following</p>

                    <li> <strong>To develop novel approaches for accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). </strong>The
                        neuropathological changes in AD start to accumulate 10-15 years before the onset of the frist
                        clinical symptoms. The ability to diagnose AD during the pre-clinical phase would allow the
                        development of potential drug interventions that may modify the disease progression. Some
                        promising methods of diagnosis that are being investigated in our Centre include PET scans to
                        detect amyloid and tau protein levels and biofluid-based biomarkers of AD. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>To explore the epigenetic mechanisms underlying AD.</strong> Epigenetic dysregulation is increasingly
                        recognized in the pathophysiology of AD. Our Centre studies a family of enzymes that controls
                        gene transcription called histone deacetylases (HDACs) and their relation to amyloid and tau
                        protein levels. Recently, they were shown to play an important role in regulating
                        neuroplasticity and cognitive function. Defining the epigenetic processes associated with AD
                        could lead to developments of new therapies that target the epigenetic molecules in the brain.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>To track the progression of neuroinflammation and tau aggregates in preclinical AD.</strong> As a
                        response to amyloid protein accumulation, immune cells in the brain release pro-inflammatory
                        factors. These factors were shown to increase the pathophysiological progression of AD. However,
                        research on the effects of neuroinflammation on cognitive decline and accumulation of tau
                        protein is limited. The longitudinal observation study conducted within the TRIAD cohort with
                        baseline and 24-month follow-up aims to fill this knowledge gap. This interface between
                        neuroinflammation and tau pathology presents as a novel potential target for therapeutic
                        interventions. </li>

                <p>The TRIAD cohort consists of study participants belonging to distinct populations, including
                    cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, as well as atypical
                    dementia. Each of these populations has a fundamental role in our investigation of biomarkers of
                    aging and dementia in the human brain.
                    Since all of our studies involve positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging
                    (MRI), we exclude individuals who are unable to undergo these procedures from our cohort. In
                    addition, we are unable to include individuals who have any uncontrolled systemic or neurological
                    diseases and people who are unable to give consent. </p>

                <h5>Cognitively healthy individuals</h5>
                <p>
                    The cognitively healthy population consists of participants who do not exhibit any cognitive
                    symptoms. These individuals do not meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment or any form of
                    dementia, nor any psychiatric disorder. The TRIAD cohort recruits both young (between 20 and 45
                    years of age) and elderly (between 55 and 85 years of age) subjects into the cognitively healthy
                    group. The aim of this population is (1) to serve as a control group for comparison purposes in our
                    studies of aging and dementia biomarkers and (2) study the pre-symptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s
                    disease.
                </p>
                <h5>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)</h5>
                <p>
                    The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) population includes participants who exhibit cognitive symptoms,
                    which include memory loss as well as problems with thinking, judgment, and language, but who do not
                    meet the criteria for dementia. Cognitive symptoms in MCI are more significant than normal
                    age-related changes in cognition, but typically are not sufficient to affect daily activities. The
                    cognitive impairment should not be explained by any other disease or condition, nor by the use of
                    certain medications. MCI diagnosis is determined through neuropsychological evaluation, MRI and PET
                    scans and is confirmed during the weekly clinical meeting. Subtypes of MCI exist, including amnesic
                    mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which episodic memory in particular is impaired. The aim of
                    this population is to study biomarkers in an intermediate stage of dementia as a diagnosis of MCI is
                    associated with a higher likelihood of progression to dementia.
                </p>
                <h5>Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)</h5>
                <p>
                    The Alzheimer’s disease (AD) population consists of individuals who have been diagnosed with
                    Alzheimer’s disease by a clinician. Alzheimer’s disease patients present with a progressive decline
                    in memory and other cognitive functions which significantly impacts daily activities, which is
                    typically accompanied by behavioral or neuropsychiatric symptoms. AD diagnosis is determined by a
                    clinician and involves neuropsychological testing as well as brain imaging tests. Aside from typical
                    Alzheimer’s disease, the AD population may include individuals who have been diagnosed with variant
                    forms of Alzheimer’s disease, including early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), posterior cortical
                    atrophy (PCA), and primary progressive aphasia (PPA). The early onset Alzheimer’s disease subgroup
                    includes individuals who develop Alzheimer’s disease symptoms before the age of 65, and is in many
                    cases explained by genetic risk factors (i.e. familial Alzheimer’s disease). Individuals with PCA
                    show marked degeneration of cerebral cortex in the posterior region of the brain, and symptoms
                    particularly affect visual function. Individuals with PPA primarily have a significant impairment in
                    language. This subgroup includes individuals who are diagnosed with the logopenic variant of PPA,
                    which is associated with slower speech and difficulties with word retrieval. The AD population,
                    including its various subgroups, is crucial in investigating how various biomarkers present in
                    different types of AD and dementia, as well as how they interact in different stages of the disease.

                <h5>Atypical Dementia</h5>
                <p>
                    The atypical dementia population includes individuals who do not meet the criteria for Alzheimer’s
                    disease and instead present with conditions including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive
                    supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and vascular dementia (vD). Diagnosis of
                    these disorders is determined by the clinician who refers us the patients. Individuals with FTD,
                    sometimes referred to as Pick’s disease, FTD is associated with deterioration in behavior,
                    personality, and language, as well as disturbances in motor functions in some cases. In particular,
                    the most common form of FTD, behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), is characterized
                    by significant alterations in behavioral, judgment, and empathy, as well as by symptoms such as
                    apathy, impulsivity, and lack of restraint based on social norms. PSP, sometimes referred to as
                    Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome, is a condition which primarily affects balance and eye
                    movements, as well as sleep. CBD is characterized by a significant impairment in motor functioning.
                    vD describes individuals whose cognitive symptoms are caused by impaired blood flow to the brain,
                    typically due to a stroke. Patients with vD typically experience cognitive decline in a step-like
                    manner, as opposed to gradually as in typical Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of the atypical dementia
                    population is primarily to examine the differences in the presentation of biomarkers in these
                    various forms of dementia, which helps to improve the differentiation and diagnosis of these
                    disorders.
